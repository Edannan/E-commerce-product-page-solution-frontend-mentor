## My process

### Built with

- HTML

I learned how to use the "after" pseudo element in css and gained more knowledge in CSS and Javascript.

### Continued development

I will now focus on studying more and creating applications with React.

### Useful resources

- No resource was used since the goal from the beginning was to build everything by myself to test my knowledge.
